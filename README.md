## Hayley Dobbs

Hey, I'm Hayley, but most people call me Dobbs. You, however, can call me whatever you like if you're offering me a job.
I've just graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech) Full Stack Development course, and now I'm hoping to find my first tech role as a junior developer.
When I'm not coding and working on projects new and old, I'm busy swearing, yes you read that right, over at [The Sweary Card Co](https://www.theswearycardco.com) to help pay the gas bill.

## Skills

**Innovative**

I saw a gap in the market for 'novelty' greetings cards and giftware, that didn't compromise on quality and used more concious manufacturing processes. I subsequently created and launched The Sweary Card Co at a premier UK trade show, going from 'late night idea' to fully operational business in the space of 10 weeks. I secured a number of retailers, including licensing with a leading UK greeting card chain. Four years later I continue to supply Direct To Consumer, to retailers in the UK, USA and Canada, and licence to several Print On Demand (POD) card companies with markets worldwide.

**Natural Problem Solver**

I thrive on solving problems, whether that be a complex business issue, or realising that having a box full of grab and go breakfast options on the counter, means I've no excuse to skip. In Admiral, I noticed a problem with a partnered, outsource company using confusing terminology with our customers, in order to justify and invoice upgrades.
I used my technical knowledge and communication skills to write, test and implement an amendment to our script, resulting in more transparent communication with our customers and ultimately reducing the number of upgrades. I also occasionally contribute to [MindSumo](https://www.mindsumo.com/challenges) to solve problems posed by major international companies, in order to practice my research and presentation skills and in return, receive feedback and sometimes small financial rewards.

**Creative**

I'm creative to the core, which I think somewhat aligns with my problem solving abilities. In 2021, as we were approaching Father's Day, a huge number of humourous greeting cards were focusing on how June 21st, the final easing of lockdown, was going to be a more important day. A week before this date, there was (another) u-turn delaying the ease, effectively making these cards redundant. With only 4 full business days until shipping cut-off, I created and licensed an alternative card design to one POD company, shipping 1500 units in its 48 hours of availability to consumers.

**Fast Learner**

I am a fast learner, but most typically in a vocational / hands-on setting. I very quickly obtained more and more responsibility in my insurance roles by proactively seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and expertise. I started The Sweary Card Co with virtually zero design or business experience, and further to the challenging (some have used stronger words!) task of single handedly exhibiting at a trade show, 10 weeks after idea conception, I have learnt design, sourcing, manufacturing, e-commerce, wholesale and licensing. In December I took on the highly-selective Makers Academy 16 Week Bootcamp, achieving 100 kata, the same day as writing my first ever solution in order to pass the entry requirements.
